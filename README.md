Odin Recipe Project
===================

The recipe project from https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes

The idea of this project is to create a basic website that is simply a main index page consisting of links to a few recipes.

The initial site is simply to cement learnt HTML skills. CSS styling will be applied at a later time. The project will also help to cement use of git and good git practice.
