            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>75g/2½oz plain flour</li>
                <li>75g/2½oz butter, cubed</li>

                <li>75g/2½oz grated mozzarella, or extra cheddar</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Put the peppers, courgette and sweet potato into a large
                    baking
                    tray. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil, season with salt and pepper and toss together.</li>
                <li>Roast for 30 minutes, or until softened and lightly browned.</li>
                <li>While the vegetables are roasting, heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan and gently fry the
                    onion
                    for 5
                    minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
                <li>Add the chilli and garlic and cook for a few seconds more. Stir in the tomatoes, Italian seasoning
                    (or
                    dried
                    oregano) and crumbled stock cube. Pour over the water and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 10
                    minutes,
                    stirring regularly. Set aside.</li>
                <li>For the cheese sauce, put the flour, butter and milk in a large saucepan and place over a medium
                    heat.
                    Whisk
                    constantly with a large metal whisk until the sauce is thickened and smooth. (Use a silicone covered
                    whisk
                    if cooking in a non-stick pan.) Stir in roughly two-thirds of the cheeses and season to taste.</li>
                <li>Take the vegetables out of the oven and add to the pan with the tomato sauce. Stir in the spinach
                    and
                    cook
                    together for 3 minutes. Season with salt and lots of ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Spoon a third of the vegetable mixture over the base of a 2½-3 litre/4½-5¼ pint ovenproof lasagne
                    dish
                    and
                    cover with a single layer of lasagne. Top with another third of the vegetable mixture (don't worry
                    if it
                    doesn't cover evenly) and a second layer of lasagne.</li>
                <li>Pour over just under half of the cheese sauce and very gently top with the remaining vegetable
                    mixture.
                    Finish with a final layer of lasagne and the rest of the cheese sauce. Sprinkle the reserved cheese
                    over
                    the
                    top.</li>
                <li>Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the pasta has softened and the topping is golden brown and
                    bubbling.
                    Stand
                    for 5 minutes before cutting to allow the filling to settle.</li>
